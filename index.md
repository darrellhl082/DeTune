# DeTune Web Music Player

## Why I built this app?
DeTune is Web-based application for playing music. The main reason why I dedicated to build this appplication is for my exercise and practice with Laravel framework. Yes, there are many music player better than it. Web-based, mobile, desktop or multi platform based like we know Spotify, Youtube Music, ITunes, JOOX, but can all of them be safe, can pass the my school computer lab network firewall?. They were blocked by central computer, so I can't open the application or visit the website. Even when I'm just writing the keyword like music, youtube, spotify or other related keyword in google search it will appear big notification "It contain useless word", "The Site will wasting your time, do other usefull think", after that the page browser will closed automatically. This is very annoying. I can't listen music for friend me when do task in computer lab and it's very disturbing me, take my focus to be angry  with the ruler. So this is the background why I planned to build DeTune and develope it better. I Hope it can passed the firewall. Because that and inspired by famous music player, I'm trying to build this app. 

##The Features in DeTune
In DeTune you can play the music in DeTune library or features like other mainstream music player. Create playlist, adding song to your own playlist. When you playing the song, there is song tracklist that lists the songs playing in the next queue. But you can also choose the song to play after the current song by click "Play Next" button. You can search song or playlist by typing the keyword. Next, the fundamental or the most important for DeTune is upload songs. because I don't use other music library or API, I have to add the songs to library. Without that, DeTune will empty and useless. So I hope that you can upload your song files for our interset. After that you can change the title or delete yout songs too.



It's using [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/) for the framework. I also use JQuery specifically AJAX method  for support data processing.
